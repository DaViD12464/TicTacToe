# TicTacToe
Popular TicTacToe game! (programmed in C# WPF)

Hi, 
This is my 1 day project (challenged myself here to try and do something like that),
in which i thought of programming an popular game: TicTacToe (PL: Kółko i Krzyżyk).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Game operates in English, I  think that I fixed all bugs, and managed to add everything (so it's 100% completed in one day).

How this game works? 
--------------------
So, after launching app game randomly chooses first player to begin, which can click on the field they want to begin with. After that game switches to second player (he can choose next field, and game switches back).
After one of the players reaches 3 fields picked of all game checks if he won, if he did 'NewGame' button will appear, and allow to play next game (player who lost game will begin this time).
If game ends with draw, 'NewGame' button will randomly pick player to begin next round.
