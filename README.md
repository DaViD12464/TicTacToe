# TicTacToe
Popular TicTacToe game! (programmed in C# WPF)

Hi, 
This is my 1 day project (challenged myself here to try and do something like that),
in which i thought of programming an popular game: TicTacToe (PL: Kółko i Krzyżyk).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Game operates in English, I  think that I fixed all bugs, and managed to add everything (so it's 100% completed in one day).

How this game works? 
--------------------
So, when you launch app the window will pop-up it will ask for player names (to follow up with scores,
and help you to be sure who is X and who is O), fill it up with your names and press enter to continue! 
(or just don't fill it and press exit on the windowbar, it will follow without names then.)
And after that game randomly chooses first player to begin, which can click on the field they want to begin with.
After that game switches to second player (he can choose next field, and game switches back).
After one of the players reaches 3 fields picked of all game checks if he won, if he did 'NewGame' button will appear, 
and allow to play next game (player who lost game will begin this time).
If game ends with draw, 'NewGame' button will randomly pick player to begin next round.
Game also shows points (your score/number or won rounds) next to your name!
